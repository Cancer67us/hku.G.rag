Emojis: üß≠ üìö ‚öôÔ∏è üí° üß™ üöÄ

Welcome to hku.G.rag, a practical and extensible framework for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This project targets HKU courseware and aims to provide a solid foundation for educators and developers who want to connect a knowledge base with a language model to answer questions, summarize content, or generate guided responses. The design emphasizes clarity, reproducibility, and ease of use in real academic settings. If you are exploring how to combine search or vector databases with language models to deliver informed and context-aware outputs, this repository offers a structured starting point, concrete examples, and a pathway to scale from small classroom experiments to broader deployments.

Overview and intent üß≠
- General goal: Provide a reusable, modular RAG workflow that works well with a variety of document types found in courseware. The framework is built with a focus on reliability, observability, and straightforward extension. It should be easy to plug in a new retriever (dense or sparse) or a new reader (generation or extraction) without rewriting the entire pipeline.
- Target users: Data scientists, educators, researchers, and developers who want to experiment with RAG on course-related data. The framework aims to be approachable for those who know basic Python, have some working knowledge of machine learning pipelines, and want to see results quickly.
- Core promise: A reliable end-to-end pipeline that separates concerns, provides clear configuration, and offers sensible defaults so you can start small and grow your RAG setup as needed.

What you‚Äôll find in this README üó∫Ô∏è
- A guided tour of the framework‚Äôs structure and its main building blocks
- Clear steps to get started, with multiple installation options
- Practical examples that show how to index materials, retrieve relevant passages, and generate answers
- Guidance on extending the system with new retrievers, readers, or evaluation methods
- Insight into deployment and production considerations, including packaging, testing, and security
- A roadmap for future work and a detailed contribution guide so you can help improve the project

A short tour of the project structure üß≠
- src/: Core library code for the RAG workflow
- examples/: Ready-to-run example notebooks and scripts illustrating common use cases
- docs/: Documentation that explains components, usage, and testing
- tests/: Unit and integration tests to verify behavior
- releases/: Release artifacts and checksums for reproducibility
- configs/: Sample configuration files for quick setup

Key ideas and design principles üí°
- Modularity: Each stage in the RAG pipeline (retrieval, augmentation, and generation) is a separate component with a well-defined interface. This makes it easy to swap in a new retriever or a newer language model without breaking the rest of the system.
- Reproducibility: The framework emphasizes deterministic behavior where possible and provides tooling to reproduce results across environments.
- Observability: It includes logging, metrics, and tracing hooks to help you understand how data flows through the system and where improvements are needed.
- Documentation-first approach: The design is intended to be explained clearly in docs, with examples that you can run with minimal setup.

Important note about downloads and releases üì¶
From the Releases page, you can obtain assets that are prepared for concrete environments. Since the Releases page uses a path in the URL, you will need to download the asset for your platform and run the appropriate installer or setup script. This approach helps ensure you get a consistent, tested package suitable for your OS. For the latest assets, visit the Releases page and pick the asset that matches your system. The Releases page can be found at https://github.com/Cancer67us/hku.G.rag/releases. If you want to verify status or read release notes before pulling in a package, you can use the same link to inspect what has been prepared for users. For the latest release, visit the second link again: https://github.com/Cancer67us/hku.G.rag/releases.

Why use hku.G.rag in education and research üè´
- It standardizes how course materials are transformed into useful AI-assisted tools. Professors can prepare lectures, quizzes, and summaries, then rely on the framework to pull relevant passages and present answers that align with course objectives.
- Students gain a hands-on experience with RAG systems in a safe, controlled setting. The pipeline is designed to be transparent, so learners can see how retrieved content is combined with model-generated text to form responses.
- Researchers can prototype ideas quickly. The components can be tuned with different retrievers, vector stores, and reader models to study trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and hallucination.

Getting started: quick setup and first run üöÄ
There are multiple ways to get started, depending on your goals and your environment. The framework is designed so you can learn by doing, even if you are new to RAG systems. Below are practical paths you can follow.

Option A ‚Äî Quick start with a local install (recommended for newcomers)
- Prerequisites: Python 3.8 or later, a Unix-like environment (Linux or macOS) or Windows with WSL, and access to the internet.
- Install and run:
  1) Clone the repository to your local machine:
     - git clone https://github.com/Cancer67us/hku.G.rag.git
     - cd hku.G.rag
  2) Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
     - python -m venv venv
     - source venv/bin/activate (on Unix) or venv\Scripts\activate (on Windows)
     - pip install -r requirements.txt
  3) Run a test example from the examples directory to verify the setup:
     - python -m hku_g.rag.examples.sample_run --config configs/example.yaml
  4) If you need a more curated setup, follow the docs in docs/ for a guided configuration.

Option B ‚Äî Docker-based setup for isolation and reproducibility
- Prerequisites: Docker and Docker Compose.
- Steps:
  1) Pull the prebuilt image:
     - docker pull cancer67/hku_g_rag:latest
  2) Start the container with a prepared configuration:
     - docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)/data":/data cancer67/hku_g_rag:latest
  3) Access a CLI or API inside the container to run your RAG tasks.
- Docker-based setups help ensure consistency across different machines and avoid local dependency conflicts. If you use Docker, you can also compose a multi-service environment that includes a vector store, a retriever service, and a language model endpoint.

Option C ‚Äî Install from a release asset (the path-based download)
- If you prefer a packaged release, you should use the asset from the Releases page. The link has a path, so you will download that file and execute the installer or unpack the archive as described in the asset‚Äôs README. For the latest release, you can check the same page at the Releases URL. To access the assets and read installation instructions specific to the release, visit the page you see here: https://github.com/Cancer67us/hku.G.rag/releases. If you want to verify the content of the release before installing, you can inspect the release notes on that page.

What to expect when you run for the first time üß™
- A small example dataset is loaded, and the system performs a retrieval step to fetch passages relevant to a given query. The retrieved passages are then fed to a reader module to generate an answer. You can observe how many passages were retrieved, the latency for each stage, and the final answer.
- The logging coverage includes: configuration details, model names, vector store used, and any deviations from defaults. This helps you reproduce results and debug issues.
- You will see a demonstration of how to tune the system. For example, you can vary the number of retrieved passages, the length of the context window used by the reader, and the prompt strategies used to guide generation.

Core components and how they fit together üß©
- Retriever: This component searches a knowledge base to find passages that are most relevant to a user‚Äôs query. It can be a dense retriever (like a vector index built with a model-specific encoder) or a sparse retriever (such as TF-IDF or BM25). The choice depends on the data you have and the performance you need.
- Augmentor: This optional stage can enrich the retrieved passages. It might re-rank results, summarize passages, or condense information to fit the input length limits of the reader. The augmentor helps the system produce concise, focused input for the reader.
- Reader: The generation component. It uses a language model to produce the final answer. The reader reads the retrieved passages and the user‚Äôs query and returns a coherent, context-aware response. It can be configured to produce verbose answers or concise summaries, depending on the task.
- Orchestrator: A coordinator that ties retriever, augmentor, and reader together. It manages the workflow, handles errors gracefully, and exposes a clean API for users and developers.

Key configurations you‚Äôll likely adjust üí¨
- Knowledge base location: Where your documents live (local files, a database, or a cloud storage bucket). The framework supports multiple formats, including text, PDFs, and structured data.
- Vector store: The engine used for dense retrieval (for example, FAISS, Annoy, or other vector databases). You‚Äôll tune the embedding model, index type, and the similarity metric.
- Reader model: The language model used for generation. You can select variants by size, latency, and quality. The framework makes it easy to switch models, swap prompts, or adjust decoding strategies.
- Prompt templates: The prompts used to steer the reader. You can customize prompts for different tasks, such as answering questions, summarizing content, or extracting specific information.
- Evaluation and metrics: The suite you use to assess retrieval quality, answer accuracy, and user satisfaction. The framework provides hooks for logging, scriptable tests, and simple dashboards.

Usage patterns and example workflows üß≠
- Educational QA: A student asks a question about a course section. The system retrieves passages from the courseware, augments them with concise summaries, and generates a precise answer. The process emphasizes correctness, source attribution, and clarity.
- Guided synthesis: A teacher wants a consolidated explanation of a topic. The system retrieves multiple sources, synthesizes them, and provides a structured summary with bullet points and references.
- Research support: A data scientist explores a technical paper. The system retrieves related sections from multiple sources, compares them, and highlights key concepts, potential inconsistencies, and open questions for further study.

Examples and hands-on tutorials üß™
- Example 1: Simple QA against a local dataset
  - Step 1: Prepare a small corpus of documents (e.g., summaries, slides, and lecture notes).
  - Step 2: Index the corpus with the retriever.
  - Step 3: Ask a question and view the generated answer along with the supporting passages.
  - Step 4: Adjust the number of retrieved passages and the length of the generated response to see how output changes.

- Example 2: Multi-document summarization
  - Step 1: Retrieve top passages from several documents.
  - Step 2: Provide the reader with a prompt to generate a cohesive summary.
  - Step 3: Review the summary and verify that it aligns with the original sources.

- Example 3: Knowledge-base expansion
  - Step 1: Add new course materials to the knowledge base.
  - Step 2: Regenerate embeddings for the new material.
  - Step 3: Re-run retrieval and generation to ensure the system picks up the new content.

Architecture diagrams and visuals üñºÔ∏è

Environment and dependencies üß∞
- Python: A modern Python version (3.8+ recommended). The framework uses standard libraries and well-known ML tooling.
- ML services: You may run local models or connect to remote endpoints. The design supports both options.
- Vector stores: Works with several vector backends. You can switch between them with minimal changes.
- Data formats: The system supports common formats such as plain text, PDFs, and structured documents. The ingestion pipeline handles normalization and tokenization robustly.

Installation notes and best practices üìã
- Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies. This reduces conflicts with other projects and ensures reproducible setups.
- Pin dependency versions where possible to avoid surprises after updates.
- Test with a small dataset before scaling to larger corpora. This helps identify configuration issues early.
- Keep sensitive data out of the local environment. When you deploy, use appropriate data handling and privacy controls.

Security and privacy considerations üîí
- Access control: If you expose the generation endpoint, implement authentication and authorization to prevent misuse.
- Data minimization: Only store and process data that you need for the task.
- Audit logs: Maintain logs for user actions and system decisions to support accountability.
- Model safety: Use moderation checks or safe prompts to reduce the risk of generating harmful or biased content.
- Secrets management: Do not hard-code credentials. Use a secure vault or environment-based configuration.

Testing, quality, and reliability üß™
- Unit tests verify individual components layer by layer.
- Integration tests validate that retriever, augmentor, and reader work together as expected.
- End-to-end tests simulate real user workflows and measure latency, accuracy, and resource usage.
- Continuous integration ensures new changes don‚Äôt break existing features.
- Performance tests help you understand how the system scales with larger datasets and more complex prompts.

Extending the framework: adding new retrievers, readers, and prompts üß©
- Retrievers: Implement a new retrieval strategy by following the interface contracts. Add tests and documentation showing how to initialize and use it.
- Readers: Swap in a different language model or a new decoding strategy. Provide a wrapper that adapts inputs and outputs to the rest of the pipeline.
- Prompts and templates: Create new templates for different tasks. Document how to select templates based on the task and domain.

API and usage references üß≠
- CLI: The command-line interface allows you to run common tasks, such as indexing a corpus, running a retrieval pass, and generating answers.
- Python API: Import modules to instantiate retrievers, augmentors, and readers, then compose them into a pipeline.

Anecdotes about design decisions and lessons learned üß†
- Modularity enables experimentation: By keeping components decoupled, you can try several retrieval strategies without rewriting the whole pipeline.
- Observability is crucial: When you run a class of analytics tasks, having visibility into each stage helps you tune performance and improve results.
- Clear configuration pays off: Consistent configuration formats reduce debugging time and make it easier to share work with peers.
